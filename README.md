# UFO Sightings
## Overview of the analysis:

This data visualization project is to present the UFO sighting data in different locations (Country, state and city) along with the date of sighting and shape of the Object as well as 
duration and comments. This data makes us think whether we are the only living ones or there are aliens.

## Results:

This user interface provides different search/filter options:
     
    - Filter through one search box:
    You can key in any of the search box for the relevant information  and it should show up with results in tabular format for the corresponding value.

## Summary:
### Drawbacks:
    - This visulazation of 'UFO Sighting' does not enable the analysts to find out locations where 'UFO Sightings' have happend most. 
    - Does not have any sortings available through which we can sort the sightings either through dates or through durations.
    - It should have pagination in place so that one does not have to scroll through so much of data and it also becomes difficult to figure out which data belongs to which header when I scroll
    down the page. 


### Recommendations:
     - Needs to have pagination to improve the User Experience.
     - Needs to have provisions to sort the data especially for dates and durations.
